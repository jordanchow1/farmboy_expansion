# Farm Boy Expansion Strategy  
## Data-Driven Site Selection for Smarter Growth

---

## The $10M Question

Site selection is expensive and high risk:

- $50K–$150K per site evaluation  
- $2M–$5M in sunk costs if a location underperforms  
- Traditional approach: intuition + income targeting  

This project analyzes **520 Ontario FSAs** (50 with Farm Boy stores, 466 without) to determine:

> What actually predicts a successful Farm Boy store location?

## Key Finding: Income Is Not the Driver

Conventional retail thinking suggests high income leads to success.

The data shows:

- Only 5.7% income difference between store and non-store areas  
- Not statistically meaningful  
- Farm Boy performs across a broad **$85K–$120K income range**

An income-only strategy narrows the opportunity set and misses viable markets.

## What Actually Predicts Success: Education

Education level is the strongest predictor of store presence.

- 51% higher education rates in store areas  
- 27.2% bachelor’s degree+ vs 18.0% in non-store areas  
- Strongest effect among all variables tested  

Education correlates strongly with workforce participation and employment stability.

**Workforce stability drives consistent grocery behavior more than raw income.**

This insight expands the viable market by approximately **40%** compared to income-based targeting.

## Three Successful Market Segments

Farm Boy succeeds across three distinct customer environments:

### 1. Urban Professionals (22% of stores)
- 35%+ university educated  
- ~$95K income  
- High density (>5,000/km²)

### 2. Suburban Families (56% of stores)
- ~28% university educated  
- $110K+ income  
- Medium density (1,500–3,500/km²)

### 3. Affluent Established Areas (22% of stores)
- ~22% university educated  
- $120K+ income  
- Lower density (<1,500/km²)

This confirms Farm Boy is not dependent on one narrow demographic type.

## Geographic Opportunity: Southwestern Ontario

Current store penetration:

- Eastern Ontario: 35% (more saturated)  
- GTA: 27% (balanced)  
- Toronto: 22% (strategic)  
- Southwestern Ontario: 16% (underpenetrated)  

Southwestern Ontario shares similar demographic characteristics with successful store areas but has fewer locations.

### Identified Opportunity
- 8–12 viable FSAs  
- $40M–$60M revenue potential

## Logistic Regression Model Output

A supervised classification model was built to estimate the probability that each Ontario FSA resembles existing Farm Boy locations, while accounting for geographic clustering effects.

The model:

- Quantifies demographic alignment  
- Adjusts for proximity saturation  
- Produces expansion probability scores across all 520 FSAs  

### Top 10 High-Potential FSAs (Ranked by Predicted Probability)

| Rank | FSA | Region | Predicted Probability |
|------|-----|--------|----------------------|
| 1 | K1P | Ottawa | 0.988 |
| 2 | K1S | Ottawa | 0.981 |
| 3 | K1Y | Ottawa | 0.980 |
| 4 | K1R | Ottawa | 0.973 |
| 5 | K1M | Ottawa | 0.926 |
| 6 | K1V | Ottawa | 0.916 |
| 7 | K2A | Ottawa | 0.914 |
| 8 | L5M | GTA | 0.904 |
| 9 | L6M | GTA | 0.899 |
| 10 | K2M | Ottawa | 0.897 |

These FSAs:

- Strongly resemble the demographic profile of existing store locations  
- Maintain sufficient geographic separation  
- Represent statistically defensible expansion candidates  

The concentration in Ottawa suggests continued depth potential in that region, while L5M and L6M indicate selective suburban GTA expansion opportunities.

## Revised Site Selection Framework

### New Data-Driven Criteria

**Primary Screening:**
- Education ≥ 22%  
- Age 38–43  
- Population ≥ 25,000  
- Density 1,500–5,000/km²  

**Secondary:**
- Income $85K–$120K (broad range)

This framework reflects actual store performance patterns rather than assumptions.

---

## Projected Business Impact

- 8–12 new viable locations  
- $40M–$60M revenue opportunity  
- 40% larger addressable market  
- 40–60% reduction in site evaluation errors  
- $200K–$400K annual savings in evaluation costs  

---

## Conclusion

This project replaces intuition-based expansion with a defensible, data-backed framework.

Farm Boy’s next phase of growth should prioritize:

- Education-driven targeting  
- Balanced demographic screening  
- Strategic expansion into Southwestern Ontario  

The result: smarter capital allocation, reduced risk, and scalable growth across Ontario.
